![soundcamp](/img/westbeach.jpg)

Join us for newhaven soundcamp over the International Dawn Chorus weekend of 5th to 6th May 2018, when small groups of people around the world will sleep outside and listen.

International Dawn Chorus Day is a world wide celebration of the dawn chorus initiated by the Wildlife Trusts to raise awareness of the deep importance of nature conservation and close relationship between human wellbeing and that of all other living species.

Newhaven Soundcamp is part of [REVEIL](http://soundtent.org/soundcamp_reveil.html), an international network of listening points. Instigated by arts collective [soundcamp](http://soundtent.org/soundcamp_about.html), REVEIL curates a live radio broadcast from these open microphones as the sun rises around the globe on the International Dawn Chorus weekend.

Newhaven Soundcamp is a small scale event for local residents to act as a simple, potent point for ecological, social, intellectual, aesthetic and spiritual engagement with Newhavenâ€™s acoustic environments - and linking this spot of Sussex Downs Biosphere (The Living Coast)  to an international network of site of ecological and sonic interest.

The broadcast will be made using a DIY radio transmitter constructed from a raspberry Pi.
