The spring programme of the MIPTL research events is taking shape. We are very excited to present a series of work, ranging from modified pianos through networked performances and biological symphonies to procedural generation in computer games. In designing the events we have tried to include three elements: musical performance, a talk, and a workshop, where the visiting researcher engages with Sussex students and researchers.

**Chris Kiefer (Wednesday, February 11th)  
Research seminar (Recital Room, 1-1.50pm) – Experiments with Mutiparametric Musical Instruments**

We start the programme with our very own [Chris Kiefer](http://luuma.net/) (Informatics) who will present his diverse work in the design of musical instruments, ranging from studies in adaptive interfaces using neural networks to physical live coding interfaces.


**Kelly Snook (Wednesday, February 25th)  
Research talk (Recital Room, 1-1.50pm) – Interactive Data Sonification Using mi.mu Gloves**

[Dr Kelly Snook](http://mimu.org.uk/#GloveTeam/3) is a former NASA planetary scientist now researching data sonification.  She is a founding member of the research team working on the [mi.mu Gloves](http://mimu.org.uk/) with Imogen Heap and other music technologists from the UK and Europe


**Leafcutter John (Thursday, March 5th)  
Performance (Meeting House 1.20pm)  
Talk and a workshop (in RR 2-7pm) – Musical Automata and Sound Sculptures**

[Leafcutter John](http://leafcutterjohn.com/) will give a performance and then lead a workshop in musical automata sound sculptures, using the popular Arduino technology, and resulting in a robotic big-band.


**Halldor Ulfarsson (Wednesday, March 18th)  
Research talk (Recital Room at 1pm) – Results of open ended acoustic investigations at the IAA  
Seminar (Recital Room 2-7pm)**

Halldor Ulfarsson will present his research around the highly impressive [Halldorophone musical instrument](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo4Jq-_tysc) (here performed by [Hildur Gudnadottir](http://www.hildurness.com/)). After the talk, he will give a seminar and a masterclass in acoustic research and instrument making.


**Tom Betts (Friday, March 20th)  
Research talk (location TBC) – The Sublime in Computer Games: Procedurally Generated Audiovisual Worlds**

[Tom Betts](http://www.nullpointer.co.uk/content/) has a background in music, programming, digital design and computer games. His latest work is “[Sir, You are Being Hunted](http://www.big-robot.com/tag/sir-you-are-being-hunted/)“, but Tom’s talk will also cover generative art and algorithmic thinking.


**Andrew McPherson (Thursday, March 26th)  
Performance (1.20 pm in the Recital Room) – Electromagnetic Piano  
Talk and a Workshop (2pm in Recital Room) – On composing for the electromagnetic piano.**

[Andrew McPherson](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~andrewm/composer/) is an innovator in new musical instruments. Although known in the world of musical instruments for a successful [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/instrumentslab/touchkeys-multi-touch-musical-keyboard), he will bring his [electromagnetic piano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hjXSuPynw) to our research event here at Sussex.

**Tim Shaw and Sébastien Piquemal (Thursday, April 9th)  
Performance (Meeting House at 1.20pm) – Fields  
Talk and workshop (Recital Room, 2-6pm) – Networked, collaborative music**

[Tim Shaw](http://tim-shaw.net/) and [Sébastien Piquemal](http://funktion.fm/#contact) will perform their networked, distributed, multi-device, multi-channel piece “[Fields](http://tim-shaw.net/fields_/)” in the Meeting House. Bring a networked device (phone, tablet, laptop). The workshop will focus on similar topics.


**Daniel Jones (Wednesday, April 15th)  
Artist talk (Recital Room at 2-4pm) – Living Symphonies and Phantom Terrains.**

[Daniel Jones](http://www.erase.net/) is a multi-talented artist and researcher know for his sound art work. He will present resent work, for example the [Living Symphonies](http://www.erase.net/projects/living-symphonies/) and [Phantom Terrains](http://www.erase.net/projects/phantom-terrains/) projects.
