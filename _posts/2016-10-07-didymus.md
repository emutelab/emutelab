**:::: Wednesday, October 12th, 1pm, @ Jane Attenborough Studio, Attenborough Centre ::::**

Brighton musician and maker <a href="http://timothydidymus.com">Timothy Didymus</a> will present his glass Harmonica project, Kosmiches Glass.

Twelve tuned (brandy) glasses are mounted on MIDI controllable turntables, creating a playable/ scriptable mechanical acoustic instrument with beautiful polyphonic voice.

Following a demonstration of the glasses in action, Timothy will talk about the inspiration behind and development of the project and will be happy take questions on any apsects of the project – aesthetic, technical, logistical etc.

This will be of interest to music, music tech and sonic media students – or anyone with an interest in new musical instruments.

<i>“Its design and engineering is of great elegance. (…) its music of transparency and transience, the sonorous resonances of heavenly voices”</i> (Sound Artist Max Eastley, 2015)
