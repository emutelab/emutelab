<h1>Materialities symposium</h1>


Join us on the morning of Thursday 5th of December, 2019 for a fast-paced symposium on the subject of materialities in music making presented by EMUTE (Experimental Music Technologies) Lab at University of Sussex.


We have two great workshops/presentations followed by a panel discussion around notions of the influence of materiality on music and sound making.


<b>Workshops/Presentations</b>

[Tom Richards](https://trsound.bandcamp.com/) will present a workshop which invites participants to utilise his Voltage Controlled Turntables with some modular synthesiser equipment. Imagine scratching a record with LFO control, or changing pitch. 
Participants are encouraged to bring vinyl records to this session. 


Tom Richards is a musician, sound designer, artist, researcher and instrument maker, working in London UK. He has performed and exhibited widely in the UK, as well as internationally in the US, Germany, Peru, Singapore, Hungary, Japan and Sweden. Selected works and live performances have taken place at Tate Britain, The Queen Elizabeth Hall, The Science Museum, Spike Island, Cafe Oto, MK Gallery, Focal Point, and Camden Arts Centre. He has recently finished his PhD (Goldsmiths/Science Museum) on the work of Daphne Oram: electronic music pioneer, and founder member of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. This research included the construction of Oram’s Mini Oramics synthesizer design (Circa 1975), a project that has since gained worldwide attention. He is represented by Nonclassical.

<b>[Thomas Grill](http://grrrr.org/)</b> and <b>[Till Bovermann](http://tai-studio.org/)</b> present activities relating to the <b>[Rotting Sounds project](https://rottingsounds.org/)</b>. Here degradation in digital systems will be explored and discussed. 
Thomas Grill (University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna) is the project manager and principal investigator. He has ample experience in both scientific and artistic research and has been composing, performing and exhibiting with digital sound for over 20 years.
Till Bovermann (University of Applied Arts Vienna) is his main discourse partner. In his artistic works, Till addresses the relationship between seemingly contradictory elements, e.g., the digital and physical realm.

<b>Round table/panel discussion - notions of materiality and influence on practice</b>
As the final event in the symposium, topics relating to notions of materiality and influence on practice are discussed by a panel of academics/composers and performers. This promises to be a lively debate relating to media archeology, liveness and audience perspective.
