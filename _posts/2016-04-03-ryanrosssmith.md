**:::: Wednesday, April 13th, 1.00pm, @ Recital Room, Falmer House 120 ::::**

The term Animated Music Notation [AMN] describes any notation that contains real-time dynamic functionalities that are necessary to its representation. Over the last 10 years, the field of contemporary animated scoring practices has emerged as a niche, yet significant thread in the new music world. This talk will introduce a speculative meta-history of the animated score, discuss the current state of contemporary animated scoring practices, and provide a practical demonstration of the author’s own notational and compositional practice. If time allows, the practical demonstration may be extended to include the audience, so please feel free to bring your instruments.
