**:::: Week starting July 6th, 3-5pm UK time, @ Zoom ::::**

Would you like to use <b>machine learning as part of musical live coding</b>? Would you like to create your own live coding language? We are inviting you to participate in a free workshop that will take place online in early June. With daily one-hour Zoom sessions and follow-up online hangouts, we will get you up and running in using our new technologies for using AI in live coding.

The MIMIC research project in machine creativity and music has provided creative coders with a toolbox for making art with cutting-edge AI technologies on the web. We chose JavaScript, the language of the Web, as the ideal interface for introducing the concepts of machine learning and machine listening to people interested in using extended intelligence in their creative work. You can create an account and get started with writing code, studying tutorials and sharing your work on the <a href="http://www.mimicproject.com">MIMIC website</a>.

However, as part of the MIMIC project we have created <b>Sema</b>. Sema is an online system for live coding in the browser with AI. Here you can apply many of the technologies we have built as part of the MIMIC work, but moreover: you can design your own live coding language!

*A screenshot of Sema. Take a look at the three videos of Sema in action below.*

We believe every new live coding language results in new musical approaches, which implies that for a diversity of music we need a diversity of languages. Sema enables you to write your own language, whether it is one piece of music, an instrument, a pattern generator, or a full blown live coding language. 

We are about to launch Sema in early July but for further information on Sema, please visit this [PAGE + URL]

There is no previous experience required to participate in this Sema workshop. You don’t need to be a skilled programmer or understand the basics of machine learning or AI. You don’t even have to be an experienced musician. This workshop will introduce the basic concepts of musical live coding with AI at your level, and get people up to speed in using Sema and creating their own live coding languages.

This video demonstrates the default language of Sema and some of its functionality

In this video we have a new language, called Rubber Duck, and we demonstrate some basic rhythm functionality.

This video shows the binary language called Nibble. It functions by swapping bits around.

These videos are small examples of what can be done with Sema. It is really up to you to decide what you will do with this system.
