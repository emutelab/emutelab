**:::: Week starting July 6th, 3-5pm UK time, @ Zoom ::::**

Would you like to use <b>machine learning as part of musical live coding</b>? Would you like to create your own live coding language? We are inviting you to participate in a free workshop that will take place online in early July. With daily Zoom sessions and follow-up online hangouts, we will get you up and running in using our new technologies for using AI in live coding.

We have been working on a web-based solution for live coding and as part of the <a href="http://www.mimicproject.com">MIMIC project</a> we have created <b>Sema</b>. Sema is an online system for live coding in the browser with AI. Here you can apply many of the technologies we have built as part of our MIMIC work, but moreover: you can design your own live coding language!

*A screenshot of Sema. Take a look at the three videos of Sema in action below.*

We believe every new live coding language results in new musical approaches, which implies that for a diversity of music we need a diversity of languages. Sema enables you to write your own language, whether it is one piece of music, an instrument, a pattern generator, or a full blown live coding language. 

Sema will be officially launched just before the start of the workshop, so you will be one of the first users to test this new technology and design your own live coding languages for machine learning in music.

There is no previous experience required to participate in this Sema workshop. You don’t need to be a skilled programmer or understand the basics of machine learning or AI. You don’t even have to be an experienced musician. This workshop will introduce the basic concepts of musical live coding with AI at your level, and get people up to speed in using Sema and creating their own live coding languages. We are hoping that workshop participants will contribute in a user-study that will help us to develop the system further.

In this video we have a new language, called <b>Rubber Duckling</b>, and we demonstrate some basic rhythm functionality.

This video shows the binary language called <b>Nibble</b>. It functions by swapping bits around.

These videos are small examples of what can be done with Sema. It is really up to you to decide what you will do with this system.
