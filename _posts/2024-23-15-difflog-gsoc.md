Jack Armitage (from Intelligent Instruments Lab, Iceland) is partnering up with Chris Kiefer to explore real-time embedded AI again, only this time based on the work of Stanford’s Felix Peterson on Differentiable Logic Gate Networks.

If you’re interesting in applying for this project, read the full project description over at the BeagleBoard forum, and get in touch!
