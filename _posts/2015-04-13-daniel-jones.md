**:::: Wednesday, April 15th, 2pm @ Recital Room, Falmer House 120 ::::**

[Daniel Jones](http://www.erase.net/) is an artist and software engineer whose work explores new ways in which sound and technology can illuminate our understanding of the world, producing large-scale sculptural sound installations and systems that translate patterns and processes into musical forms. Daniel will discuss two recent works — Living Symphonies, a touring outdoor piece that grows in the same way as a forest ecosystem, and Phantom Terrains, a platform that enables its hearing-impaired wearer to hear the surrounding landscape of wifi networks — and argues that these  two  seemingly disparate outputs inhabit the same creative spectrum.

Short biography:

Daniel Jones is an artist and software engineer whose work explores new ways in which sound and technology can illuminate our understanding of the world. This manifests itself in both scientific and artistic output: he has published work on process composition, creativity theory, systems ecology and artificial life, and exhibits his sound work internationally, harnessing algorithmic processes to create self-generating artworks.

Recent works include [Phantom Terrains](http://phantomterrains.com/) (with Frank Swain, 2014), a platform for ubiquitous sonification of wireless network landscapes; [Living Symphonies](http://www.livingsymphonies.com/) (with James Bulley, 2014-), a landscape sound work that grows in the same way as a forest ecosystem; [Global Breakfast Radio](http://globalbreakfastradio.com/)(with Seb Emina, 2014-), an autonomous radio station that broadcasts live radio from wherever the sun is rising; [The Listening Machine](http://www.thelisteningmachine.org/) (with [Peter Gregson](http://petergregson.co.uk/), 2012), a 6-month-long online composition which translates social network dynamics into a piece of orchestral music, recorded with [Britten Sinfonia](http://www.brittensinfonia.com/) and commissioned by the BBC/Arts Council’s [The Space](http://www.thespace.org/); [Variable 4](http://erase.net/projects/variable4/) (with [James Bulley](http://www.jamesjbulley.com/), 2011), an outdoor sound installation which transforms live weather conditions into musical patterns; [Maelstrom](http://erase.net/projects/maelstrom/) (with James Bulley, 2012), which uses audio material from media-publishing websites as a distributed, virtual orchestra; [Horizontal Transmission](http://erase.net/projects/horizontal-transmission/) (2011), a digital simulation of bacterial communication mechanisms; and [AtomSwarm](http://erase.net/projects/atomswarm/) (2006—2009), a musical performance system based upon swarm dynamics.

Daniel’s engineering work includes [Chirp](http://chirp.io/), a platform and iOS app for sharing information over sound, shortlisted for the Design Museum’s Designs Of The Year; the 3D audio engine for mobile games [Papa Sangre](http://www.papasangre.com/) and [The Nightjar](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/the-nightjar/id431598741?mt=8), nominated for two BAFTAs including “Audio Achievement”. He co-ordinated the technical infrastructure for [The Fragmented Orchestra](http://www.thefragmentedorchestra.com/), winner of the prestigious PRSF New Music Award 2008, and was more recently a fellow on the [Mozilla Webmaker](http://www.erase.net/weblog/2013-12/the-markup-melodium) programme.
