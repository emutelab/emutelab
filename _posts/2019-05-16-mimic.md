MIMIC is a web platform for the artistic exploration of musical machine learning and machine listening. We have designed this collaborative platform as an interactive online coding environment, engineered to bring new technologies in AI and signal processing to artists, composers, musicians and performers all over the world.

The <a href="http://www.mimicproject.com">MIMIC platform</a> has a built-in audio engine, machine learning and machine listening tools that makes it easy for creative coders to get started using these techniques in their own artistic projects. The platform also includes various examples of how to integrate external machine learning systems for sound, music and art making. These examples can be forked and further developed by the users of the platform.

Over the next three years, we aim to integrate brand new and developing creative systems into this platform so that they can be more easily used by musicians and artists in the creation of entirely new music, sound, and media, enabling people to understand and apply new computational techniques such as Machine Learning in their own creative work.

MIMIC or "Musically Intelligent Machines Interacting Creatively" is a three year AHRC-funded project, run by teams at Goldsmiths College, Durham University and the University of Sussex.
