**:::: Wednesday, Feb 25th, 1pm, @ Recital Room, Falmer House 120 ::::**

This talk will present the work [Robert Thomas](http://www.dizzybanjo.com/) has been exploring with various companies over the last 5 years. He will be discussing how while music making technology has evolved radically over the last 20 years, the process of music distribution and the form of music itself has remained conceptually the same for many decades, stretching back to the beginning of recorded music and beyond. Through a range of projects he will present how music which is distributed as software, and using sensor technology, can behave in exciting new ways and relate very directly to user experience. The discussion will range from apps on smartphones, to wearables, VR and AR. Finally Robert will discuss how music as software can perform a quantifiable function for listeners. No longer ‘just’ entertainment – music can become a tool to achieve practical goals and create value or reduce risk.

Following the talk Robert will host a workshop demonstrating and under the hood view of how some of his projects work technically.
