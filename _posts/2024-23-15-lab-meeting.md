On Tuesday 19th of March we have a double bill:

- Chris Kiefer and Dimitris Kyriakoudis will be talking/demoing the uSEQ live coding module, some recent developments with the firmware & hardware, and the collaboration they are doing with Music Thing Modular to port the uSEQ firmware to their upcoming hybrid and programmable module + a new editor.
