**:::: Wednesday, October 26th, 1pm @ Sussex Humanities Lab, Silverstone ::::**

This term we are pleased to have a visit from instrument designer, musician and researcher, Enrique Tomás. Enrique will be working with us and presenting his work in one of the Music Department’s lunch time seminars (in the SHL). See the abstract for the talk and bio below:

**Instruments as Scores: Musical Interfaces Beyond Representation**

The development of new approaches to instrumentality during the decade of 1960 has contributed to the dual perception of instrument as scores. For many performers, the instrument became the score of what they played. This artistic hybridization carries substantial questions about the nature of our scores and about the relationships among instruments, performers and musical works. In my talk, I will contextualize the historical origins of this instrumental development within digital humanities, in particular Drucker’s theory of performative materiality, Barad’s posthumanist performativy and Ingold’s procesual and relational description of material properties. Following this approach, I will defend that a ‘hybrid’ and ‘performative’ understanding of writing music, which shifts the focus from linguistic and visual representations to discursive practices, is one such alternative for suggesting new practices of notation and interface design.
