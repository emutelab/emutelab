**:::: Sunday, November 13th, 9:30am @ Sheffield Hallam University ::::**

The AlgoMech Arts Research Symposium takes place within the <a href="http://www.algomech.com/">Festival of Algorithmic and Mechanical Movement</a>, on the 13th November 2016 at the Sheffield Hallam University in Sheffield, UK.  AlgoMech celebrates a resurgence of making in performance, where creative processes are made visible during a live event. Rather than presenting technology as seamless, we pick at the seams, exposing its innards as human-made and reconfigurable. We will also go beyond fashionable notions of technology to take the long view; bringing together mechanical, kinetic, electronic, and software arts, from periods spanning the stone age to present day, building a picture of the human maker as both digital and analogue, thinking and feeling, embodied yet reaching beyond what is bodily possible. The festival will take place across Sheffield, and will include concerts, talks, hands-on workshops, and a club night. The arts research symposium will focus on the latest developments in this field, drawing on both academic and artistic perspectives.

Tickets are £15/£25 (and include lunch, coffee and evening concert). Tickets can be purchased <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/arts-research-symposium-part-of-algomech-tickets-28182881758">here</a>.
