<b>::::: Wednesday, February 21st, 2018 @ ACCA, 8pm :::::</b>

In collaboration with the Attenborough Centre for the Creative Arts, we are organising an eventful day with the <a href="http://www.beast.bham.ac.uk/offspring/beer/">Birmingham Ensemble for Electroacoustic Research</a> (BEER).

<b>Performance</b>

This performance by the Birmingham Ensemble for Electroacoustic Research, created in collaboration with the <a href="http://artcms.web.cern.ch/artcms/">art@CMS</a> project at CERN in Switzerland, involves the real-time sonification of data streams from the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most complex particle accelerator. Experimental data containing clues towards possible 'new physics' becomes the raw material for improvised music and visualisations programmed by the ensemble with an aim to creating a result that while beautiful, is also both musically and scientifically meaningful.

<b>Workshop</b>

This workshop for composers and artists explores the possibilities of using scientific data as a resource for music and sonic art, with particular focus on sonifying data from the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, the world’s largest particle accelerator. An introduction to the physics involved will be followed by an exploration of strategies for converting the data into sound. Previous experience of computer music environments is useful, but not required.

Places in the workshop are limited. Please sign up <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/2cTbIecn62yPcwmf1">here</a>.
