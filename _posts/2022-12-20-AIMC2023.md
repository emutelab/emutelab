### AIMC 2023

31 August - 1 September @ University of Sussex, Brighton, UK

The **International Conference on AI and Music Creativity** is an annual conference bringing together a community of people working on the application of AI in musical practice, with topics ranging from performance systems, computational creativity,  machine listening, robotics, sonification, and more.

### **Conference Theme**

The theme of AIMC 2023 is **Intelligent Performance Systems**, where we are interested in how AI is applied in real-time artistic performance. This includes physical musical instruments, music theatre, software, as well as interactive installations. Our **programme** includes performances, installations, demo sessions in addition to academic papers. We seek to be hands-on, performative, experimental and collaborative, opening up opportunities for collaboration and co-playing. 

### **Organisers**

This conference will be held at the University of Sussex. We seek to foster a creative and friendly atmosphere in the sunny, vibrant city of Brighton, UK. It is co-hosted between two research labs active in music and AI research: the **Experimental Music Technologies Lab** ([www.emutelab.org](http://www.emutelab.org/)) and the **Intelligent Instruments Lab** ([www.iil.is](http://www.iil.is/)). 

Main deadlines are in March 2023, but please find further information about indicative topics, conference theme and submission information on the **Conference website:**  [https://aimc2023.pubpub.org](https://aimc2023.pubpub.org/cfp)
