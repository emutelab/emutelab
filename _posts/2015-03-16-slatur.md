After Tom Betts’ talk on the Sublime in Computer Games, we are lucky to have visitors from Iceland in the form of the experimental music [SLÁTUR composer collective](http://www.slatur.is/). They will perform a concert with compositions by SLÁTUR members. The performance includes electronic compositions with live electronic processing as well as music using animated notation, found objects as musical instruments and video projections.

**Short description:**

SLÁTUR – an artistically obtrusive composer collective centered in Reykjavík, Iceland. Since 2005 its members have been working on various types of experiments. These include animated notation using computer graphics, interactivity, various experiments with sounds and tunings, performance art and the development of limited and isolated musical universes. The members share ideas and methods freely while the final products are usually independent efforts.
