We are holding an Emute Lab Monthly meeting, roughly on the final Tuesday of each month.

We are really excited to be able to host Victor Shepardson this month.

Victor is a post-graduate research at the Intelligent Instrument Lab in Reykjavik (http://www.https://iil.is) where he is exploring a lived in approach to designing with AI for new musical instruments.  Victor has kindly agreed to talk us through the art of training RAVE Models (Realtime Audio Variational autoEncoder models https://github.com/acids-ircam/RAVE).  From there we hope to expand the discussion to how we might manipulate the resulting model in different ways.

Date: Tuesday 27th February
Time: 1pm
Location: Sussex Humanities Lab
Zoom: This is an open list so please email me for the Zoom link if you wish to join.
