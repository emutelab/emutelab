**:::: Wednesday, June 10th, 2-7.30pm @ Digital Humanities Lab ::::**

The Informatics and Music departments have joined forces to provide two physical computing workshops in the 2015 spring term. The focus is on input-processing-output mechanisms in micro-robot building, using the Arduino platform. In the first workshop in March we built robots that exuded smell by being touched.

The [second workshop](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1SC4OTupU8Yb7iRCiwDYoSQ8sxwVUQBH6gw2XiU1PdGU/viewform) is open for participation, and here we will focus on modular robot-making, where participants build projects using sensors, motors and physical materials. The workshop will take place in the new Digital Humanities Lab (Silverstone Building) which is the physical lab for the [Sussex Humanities Lab](https://humslab.wordpress.com/).
