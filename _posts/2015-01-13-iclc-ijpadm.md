The AHRC funded Live Coding Research Network – a collaboration between Sussex and Leeds – has recently put out two separate call for papers. The first one is for the [International Conference for Live Coding](http://iclc.livecodenetwork.org/) to be held in July 2015 in Leeds, and the call can be found in the [ICLC website](http://iclc.livecodenetwork.org/cfp.html).

The second call for papers is for issue 12.2 of the Journal of Performance Art and Digital Media to be published in 2012. The call is on the [Taylor and Francis journal site](http://explore.tandfonline.com/cfp/ah/performance-arts-and-digital-media-call-for-papers).

Authors are encouraged to submit to both and turn their conference paper into a journal article if the theme fits the JPADM call. In terms of timing, this fits well: the ICLC conference is in July, and the 500 abstracts for the JPADM are due in before September 15th.
