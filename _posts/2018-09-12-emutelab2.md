## Andrew Duff

Andrew Duff is a sound artist and organiser of the University of Sussex based Brighton Modular meet. Since the late 1980s, Andrew has amassed a large collection of electronic music, and collected, modified and experimented with a range of, generally, Japanese analogue synthesizers, DJing, recording music and performing live at club nights and various other events. Since completing a Masters in Design and Digital Media in 2000, he has been involved in teaching, academic research, and continues to develop his own work. Since 2012 his work has been largely based around the use of a eurorack modular synthesiser and modified Vectrex games console for audio/visual and performance based vector oscillographics.
