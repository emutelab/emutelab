**:::: Saturday, May 29th, all day @ Creativity Zone ::::**

The yearly [Brighton Modular Meet](http://brightonmodularmeet.co.uk/) organised by Andrew Duff will take place on May 29th in the [Creativity Zone](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/acca/creativityzone) at the University of Sussex. Here, modular synth buffs from across the country convene for a day of showcasing, discussing, and experimenting.

A modular synth concert is planned for the evening. Further info on that later.
