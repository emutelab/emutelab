<p><b>Hannah Marshall (cello) &amp; Otto Willberg (double bass)</b></p>

<p><b>Hannah Marshall</b> is a cellist who is continuing to extract, invent, and exorcize as many sounds and emotional qualities from her instrument as she can. She has been a regular member of Alexander Hawkins’ Ensembles and has toured in Europe and South America with Luc Ex and Veryan Weston’s ensembles – SOL 6 &amp; 12. She plays with ‘String Terrorists’ - Barrel (a trio with Violinist Alison Blunt &amp; Violist/poet Ivor kallin). And has been invited by Fred Frith and Suichi Chino in their residencies at café Oto. She also plays with Terry Day, Tim Hodgkinson, Roger Turner, Paul May, Kay Grant, and the London Improvisers Orchestra.</p>

<p><b>Noise Peddler</b> (Danny Bright + Lee Westwood): two pedalboards, four amplifiers, and no inputs. Noise Peddler perform part-composed, part-improvised sounds generated and manipulated by guitar pedals.</p>

<p><b>Danny Bright</b> is a composer, sound designer, recordist, and sonic manipulator working across the fields of music, performance, installation, theatre and media. His practice explores the boundaries between sound/music/noise and space/place/memory; he is currently developing multi-modal compositional, performance, critical and installation work investigating sonic temporalities and auditory ‘ghostings’. Danny performs on guitar, samplescapes, tape, text/voice, and electronics as an ensemble member/leader, solo artist and improviser. He also works as a sound designer and composer for internationally recognised arts, theatre and media companies, and as a producer, recordist, sound technologist and engineer.</p>

<p>Described by the Musician’s Union as “one of the UK’s most exciting and versatile musicians”, <b>Lee Westwood</b> is a guitarist and composer whose wide-ranging output stems from a long-term tenacity for musical exploration.</p>

<p>Far from ordinary, Lee’s works range from the Geometry-Music crossover of his multimedia exhibition ‘A Hidden Order’ (Saatchi Gallery, Athr, SCOPE) to a vast back-catalogue of intimate works for solo guitar; from headlining festival stages with Hip-Hop groups and Prog Folk acts (Dizraeli &amp; The Small Gods; Le Juki) to commissions and performances from some of the UK’s leading ensembles, soloists and choirs (Joby Burgess; New Music Players; Workers Union Ensemble; Musarc; Riot Ensemble; Notes Inégales).</p>
