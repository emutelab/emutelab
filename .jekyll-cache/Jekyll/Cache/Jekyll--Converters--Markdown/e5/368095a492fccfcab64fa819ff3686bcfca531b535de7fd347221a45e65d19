<p>The MIPT Lab had a strong presence at the conference: Sally Jane Norman gave a keynote on liveness in performance entitled ‚ÄúLive Coding and Embodied Action in Performance Contexts‚Äù, Chris Kiefer presented a paper and performed at the Algorave, and Thor Magnusson performed with his new <a href="http://github.com/thormagnusson/cmn">CMN language</a> as well as at the Algorave. The event was well documented thanks to MFM research funds, enabling Paul McConnell to attend armed with recording equipment. Honorary members of the lab, Nick Collins and Matt Yee-King also performed and gave papers.</p>
