<p>Ecoacoustics is a recently established discipline that investigates the ecological role of sounds. A set of processes in four [<em>adaptive, behavioural, geographical, ecosemiotic</em>] domains supports and guides the development of ecoacoustics.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <em>adaptive</em>  domain includes evolutionary mechanisms that join sound typology with the physical and biological characteristics of the environment and create frequency partitioning among species to reduce competition.</li>
  <li>The behavioural  domain addresses interspecific signals associated with geophysical and anthropogenic sounds that operate to shape temporary acoustic communities and orient species to select suitable acoustic habitats.</li>
  <li>The geographic  domain pertains to the geography of sound, an entity composed of three subordinate acoustic objects: sonotopes, soundtopes, and sonotones, which are operationally delimited in a geographical and temporal space by the distribution of the ecoacoustic events. The ecoacoustic events allow the classification of complex configurations/patterns of acoustic signals and represent the grain of a soundscape mosaic.</li>
  <li>The ecosemiotic  domain operates by  communication mechanisms within the species level according to a function-specific perception of the acoustic information facilitated by encoding/decoding processes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Long-term monitoring, habitat health, biodiversity assessment, soundscape conservation and ecosystem management makes ecoacoustics relevant in several fields where human intrusion in ecosystems is growing at an unprecedented rate.</p>

<h3 id="biography">Biography</h3>
<p>Almo Farina is an Italian naturalist and Professor of Ecology in the Department of Pure and Applied Sciences, Urbino University, Italy. He has dedicated the last ten years to elaborate new theories in landscape ecology, soundscape ecology and ecoacoustics. He considers the protection of the biological diversity integrated with the human cultural heritage and well-being, a priority of its scientific and human mission. In 2014 Almo was elected the first President of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ecoacousticssociety/">International Society of Ecoacoustics</a>, and in 2015 he founded the <a href="http://www.iinsteco.org/">International Institute of Ecoacoustics</a> .</p>
