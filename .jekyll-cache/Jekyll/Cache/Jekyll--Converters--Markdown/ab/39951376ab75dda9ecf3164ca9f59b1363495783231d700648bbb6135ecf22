I"<p>The <a href="https://forumarimi.wixsite.com/arimi">Forum for Immersive Augmented Reality Instruments</a>, a two-day networking event, took place on June 19-20th. It brought together diverse participants across University of Sussex schools, research centres and labs, together with representatives from local art organisations and creative industries, with a view to understanding cultural transformations from Augmented Reality (AR), and to build new interdisciplinary research partnerships.</p>

<p>The network event was designed to explore new forms of creation, experience and digital culture through tool and instrument-making, whilst achieving independence from existing distribution structures, and bringing together transdisciplinary discussions on condition of ‘seeing’ (Paul &amp; Toolin 2014, p53) as sensing.</p>

<p>Day one saw presentations from participants under the themes of culture, sensing, instruments and arts.  On day two, participants explored AR practically through two workshops; an ‘unplugged’ workshop where groups built and discussed hypothetical AR technologies, and a ‘plugged’ workshop where groups experimented with off-the-shelf AR technologies, using visual, audio and haptics materials.</p>

<p>The Forum for ARImI was led by Cécile Chevalier &amp; Chris Kiefer in partnership with Kirk Woolford, University of Surrey. It was supported by the Doctoral School’s Researcher-Led Initiative (RLI) Fund,  the School of Media, Film, and Music, Sussex Humanities Lab &amp; EMuTe Lab.</p>
