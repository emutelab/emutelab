I"Y<p><strong>:::: Thursday, April 9th, 1.20pm @ Meeting House, University of Sussex ::::</strong></p>

<p><em>NOTE: Please bring a networked device – a computer, phone, tablet, etc.</em></p>

<p>In this piece, Sébastien and Tim explore mobile technology as a medium for sound diffusion. Audience members can join in by simply connecting to a specific website with their mobile phone, laptop or tablet. The connected devices become an array of speakers that the performers can control live, resulting in an omni-directional sonic experience. This project provides an alternative method for sound spatialisation as well as offering new ways in which audiences can engage in sonic works. Fields has been performed in Helsinki, Berlin, Athens, Lisbon and Newcastle.</p>

<p>In a workshop afterwards, Tim and Sebastien will introduce participants to using Fields as a performance or installation tool. We will cover technical aspects such as setting up, configuration and customisation of the system. We will also share experience gathered from a year of composing for tiny mobile phone speakers, trying different audience configurations and dealing with latency and other technical limitations. The workshop will allow for participants to create their own work using Fields and will culminate in a listening session and an open discussion.</p>
