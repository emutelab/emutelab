<p>The term Animated Music Notation [AMN] describes any notation that contains real-time dynamic functionalities that are necessary to its representation. Over the last 10 years, the field of contemporary animated scoring practices has emerged as a niche, yet significant thread in the new music world. This talk will introduce a speculative meta-history of the animated score, discuss the current state of contemporary animated scoring practices, and provide a practical demonstration of the authorâ€™s own notational and compositional practice. If time allows, the practical demonstration may be extended to include the audience, so please feel free to bring your instruments.</p>
