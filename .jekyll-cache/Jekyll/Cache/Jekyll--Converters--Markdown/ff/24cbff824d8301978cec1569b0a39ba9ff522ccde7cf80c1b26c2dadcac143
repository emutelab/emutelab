I"„<p><strong>:::: Thursday, May 9th, 5.30-7.30pm, @ The SHL, Sussex University ::::</strong></p>

<p>During the next academic year, the Emute Lab will collaborate with the Sussex Humanities Lab in running monthly ‚ÄúCreative Audio Coding‚Äù evenings in the SHL. This will be a space for people to come and work on their sound and music projects, but we will also introduce selected technologies (such as new software and languages) or techniques (such as synthesis techniques, embodied control or machine learning) in each session. In this teaser on May 9th, we will start with the very popular and powerful <a href="https://supercollider.github.io">SuperCollider</a> audio programming language. This system has been instrumental in establishing the practice of <a href="http://www.toplap.org">live coding</a> and has been the main environment for creative sound coding for over two decades.</p>

<p>In this session Thor Magnusson will give a short introduction to SuperCollider, and his recently republished tutorial <a href="https://leanpub.com/ScoringSound">Scoring Sound: Creative Music Coding with SuperCollider</a>.</p>

<p>We will bring some drinks and snack, but participants will have to bring their laptops and headphones. <strong>Everyone is welcome</strong>, especially beginners and the curious, and we especially encourage people from outside the University of Sussex to join us in these sessions.</p>

<p>See you in the lab.</p>
