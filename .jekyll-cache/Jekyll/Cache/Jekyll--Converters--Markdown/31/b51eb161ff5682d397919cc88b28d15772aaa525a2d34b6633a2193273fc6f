<p><strong>Jesper Pedersen</strong><br />
<strong>Title: Live performance with modular synths</strong></p>

<p>Live performance with modular synthesizers can be a challenge. Even more so when performing solo. In this talk, Jesper will introduce his current hybrid live rig and demonstrate some of the performance capabilities of his DIY Serge modular.</p>

<p><b>Bio:</b> Jesper Pedersen is a composer, performer, educator and DIYer based in Reykjavik. He studied Music Technology at Aalborg University in Denmark and has been developing experimental works that mixes DIY technology with acoustic musical instruments through the use of real time software based animated graphical notation. Recently he has been focussing on performing on modular synthesizers both solo and in collaborations such as the North Atlantic postcolonial outfit The Remains of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>His works have been performed internationally by S.L.Á.T.U.R., Goodiepal and Pals, Duo Harpverk, Ensemble Adapter, the Iceland Symphony Orchestra, Ilan Volkov, Katie Buckley, Ingólfur Vilhjámsson at festivals including the Tectonics Festival, Nordlichter Biennale, Sonic Festival, OpenDays, Rainy Days, Summartónar, Raflost, Geiger, Sláturtíð, Dark Music Days and Nordic Music Days.

<p><strong>Sam Rees</strong><br />
<strong>Title: Visual Noise, Discordant Clutter</strong></p>

<p>Sam will present examples of his personal work with interactive dioramas using circuit-bent toy robots as well as his influences and current interests, from outsider art to voodoo shrines, scavenger populations and robot-human empathy.</p>

<p><b>Bio: </b> A generalist with a passion for DIY cultures, manifesting itself through printed matter, installation, workshops and events. British born, Sam studied interactive arts in Manchester in 2003, but has been living in Iceland for the last 6 years.

<p>Recent work focuses on a series of interactive dioramas - sequential narrative installations, eclectic assemblage with circuit bent toys, exploring technological waste and our perception of robotics. Recent activities include a residency at Signal Culture in upstate New York, and exhibitions at the Reykjavik Electronic Arts Festival and Nordic House.</p>
