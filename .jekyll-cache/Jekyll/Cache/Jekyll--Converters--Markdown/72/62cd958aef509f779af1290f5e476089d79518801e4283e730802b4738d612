<p><a href="http://www.erase.net/">Daniel Jones</a> is an artist and software engineer whose work explores new ways in which sound and technology can illuminate our understanding of the world, producing large-scale sculptural sound installations and systems that translate patterns and processes into musical forms. Daniel will discuss two recent works ‚Äî Living Symphonies, a touring outdoor piece that grows in the same way as a forest ecosystem, and Phantom Terrains, a platform that enables its hearing-impaired wearer to hear the surrounding landscape of wifi networks ‚Äî and argues that these  two  seemingly disparate outputs inhabit the same creative spectrum.</p>
