I"<p>The spring programme of the MIPTL research events is taking shape. We are very excited to present a series of work, ranging from modified pianos through networked performances and biological symphonies to procedural generation in computer games. In designing the events we have tried to include three elements: musical performance, a talk, and a workshop, where the visiting researcher engages with Sussex students and researchers.</p>

<p><strong>Chris Kiefer (Wednesday, February 11th)<br />
Research seminar (Recital Room, 1-1.50pm) – Experiments with Mutiparametric Musical Instruments</strong></p>

<p>We start the programme with our very own <a href="http://luuma.net/">Chris Kiefer</a> (Informatics) who will present his diverse work in the design of musical instruments, ranging from studies in adaptive interfaces using neural networks to physical live coding interfaces.</p>

<p><strong>Kelly Snook (Wednesday, February 25th)<br />
Research talk (Recital Room, 1-1.50pm) – Interactive Data Sonification Using mi.mu Gloves</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://mimu.org.uk/#GloveTeam/3">Dr Kelly Snook</a> is a former NASA planetary scientist now researching data sonification.  She is a founding member of the research team working on the <a href="http://mimu.org.uk/">mi.mu Gloves</a> with Imogen Heap and other music technologists from the UK and Europe</p>

<p><a href="http://leafcutterjohn.com/">Leafcutter John</a> will give a performance and then lead a workshop in musical automata sound sculptures, using the popular Arduino technology, and resulting in a robotic big-band.</p>

<p><strong>Halldor Ulfarsson (Wednesday, March 18th)<br />
Research talk (Recital Room at 1pm) – Results of open ended acoustic investigations at the IAA<br />
Seminar (Recital Room 2-7pm)</strong></p>

<p>Halldor Ulfarsson will present his research around the highly impressive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo4Jq-_tysc">Halldorophone musical instrument</a> (here performed by <a href="http://www.hildurness.com/">Hildur Gudnadottir</a>). After the talk, he will give a seminar and a masterclass in acoustic research and instrument making.</p>

<p><strong>Tom Betts (Friday, March 20th)<br />
Research talk (location TBC) – The Sublime in Computer Games: Procedurally Generated Audiovisual Worlds</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.nullpointer.co.uk/content/">Tom Betts</a> has a background in music, programming, digital design and computer games. His latest work is “<a href="http://www.big-robot.com/tag/sir-you-are-being-hunted/">Sir, You are Being Hunted</a>“, but Tom’s talk will also cover generative art and algorithmic thinking.</p>

<p><strong>Andrew McPherson (Thursday, March 26th)<br />
Performance (1.20 pm in the Recital Room) – Electromagnetic Piano<br />
Talk and a Workshop (2pm in Recital Room) – On composing for the electromagnetic piano.</strong></p>
