<p>We are organising an Algorave in Brighton as part of the <a href="https://www.britishsciencefestival.org">British Science Festival</a> programme.</p>

<p>Algorave is a combination of â€œalgorithmsâ€ and â€œraveâ€, the opportunity to dance to alien rhythms and freaky visuals, all created from code before your eyes. The Algorave scene is fast-growing around the world, reaching over 50 cities.</p>

<p>â€œThe scene at an algorave is often what youâ€™d expect from any good techno night - a dark room, engaging visuals. a decent, bass-heavy speaker set-up, and lots of people ready to dance. .. performers at algoraves respond to each other and the audience in real time, often projecting the lines of code onto the walls as they type. ltâ€™s coding as improvisation and experiment..â€ - The Wire magazine</p>

<p>â€œLive coders write computer programs live, while the programs generate their music, but the focus is on people dancing and seriously enjoying themselvesâ€ - Dazed and Confused</p>

<p>â€.. not so much a revolution as a de-volution, a rolling back to the backend of music production, where the possibilities of the encoded information inside computer software is open and endlessâ€ - Mixmag</p>
