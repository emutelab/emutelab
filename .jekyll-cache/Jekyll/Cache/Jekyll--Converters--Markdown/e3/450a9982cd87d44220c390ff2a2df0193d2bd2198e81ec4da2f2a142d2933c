<p><b>Hannah Marshall (cello) &amp; Otto Willberg (double bass)</b></p>

<p>A duo that has been finding an improvised language of rich sonic, textural and rhythmic counterpoint over the last year with performances at Fizzle - Birmingham, Bristol Music Club, Flim Flam - London and Fuse Arts Space - Bradford.</p>

<p><b>Hannah Marshall</b>
I experiment with approaches to playing the ‘Cello using improvisation as a means to explore sound, music and performance. I play with a range of experimental groups and projects in the UK and Europe. I also collaborate with other performers and artists who work in mediums including theatre, performance, dance, storytelling and film.</p>

<p>“<em>Ask your ears :] Exploring sonic territories and visiting musical antipodes, demonstrating an esoteric approach to instrumentation that is truly unique</em>”- DreamCraeft recommendation</p>

<p>“<em>with Marshall’s impeccable timing and skill for finding strong yet subtle gestures…</em> ” “<em>..Vicious!.</em>”- Dan Warburton</p>

<p>“<em>Hannah Marshall has proven herself to be a solo player of imagination and intelligence; recording an album of deceptively simple but very rewarding and hypnotic music. A series of small meals that combine in a feast for the ears and mind.</em>” - ears for eyes</p>

<p><b>Danny Bright</b> is a composer, sound designer, recordist, and sonic manipulator working across the fields of music, performance, installation, theatre and media. His practice explores the boundaries between sound/music/noise and space/place/memory; he is currently developing multi-modal compositional, performance, critical and installation work investigating sonic temporalities and auditory ‘ghostings’. Danny performs on guitar, samplescapes, tape, text/voice, and electronics as an ensemble member/leader, solo artist and improviser. He also works as a sound designer and composer for internationally recognised arts, theatre and media companies, and as a producer, recordist, sound technologist and engineer.</p>

<p>Described by the Musician’s Union as “one of the UK’s most exciting and versatile musicians”, <b>Lee Westwood</b> is a guitarist and composer whose wide-ranging output stems from a long-term tenacity for musical exploration. Far from ordinary, Lee’s works range from the Geometry-Music crossover of his multimedia exhibition ‘A Hidden Order’ (Saatchi Gallery, Athr, SCOPE) to a vast back-catalogue of works for solo guitar; from headlining festival stages with Hip-Hop groups and Prog Folk acts (Dizraeli &amp; The Small Gods; Le Juki) to commissions from some of the UK’s leading ensembles and choirs (LSO, WUE; Musarc; Riot Ensemble; Notes Inégales). – <a href="www.lee-westwood.com">www.lee-westwood.com</a></p>
