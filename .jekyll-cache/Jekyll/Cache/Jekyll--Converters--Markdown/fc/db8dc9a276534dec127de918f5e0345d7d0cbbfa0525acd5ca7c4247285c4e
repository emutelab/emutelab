I"(<p><strong>How do we compose for new instruments? Can we redesign old instruments for new music? What happens when familiar instruments gain new expressive scope?</strong></p>

<p>These are questions we will be investigating in two workshops running as part of the ICLI conference (International Conference on Live Interfaces – http://www.liveinterfaces.org), to be held at the University of Sussex in Brighton in June 29/30th.</p>

<p>Registration is now open for composers and performers to join the workshops in order to create pieces for two new musical instruments – the halldorophone and the magnetic resonator piano – and perform at the opening of the ICLI conference in the Attenborough Centre for the Creative Arts.</p>

<p>The workshops will engage with questions of legacy, tradition, notation, performance and improvisation. They will deal with how instruments frame our compositional thoughts, provoking questions as to what happens when familiar instruments gain new sonic and performance capabilities.</p>

<p>If you are interested in joining one of these two-day workshops, please fill in the registration form here:</p>

<p>Halldorophone – <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/iszthAUWb2">http://goo.gl/forms/iszthAUWb2</a>
<br />Magnetic Resonator Piano – <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/rGZfVmWesn">http://goo.gl/forms/rGZfVmWesn</a></p>

<p>We will confirm by June 17th. This application process is because there are limited places and we wish to ensure a good balance of participants. Workshops cost £50 which includes lunches on both days.</p>

<p>In order to facilitate participation by creative musicians outside academia we are making these workshops open without attending the rest of the ICLI conference.</p>
