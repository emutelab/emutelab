I"3<p><strong>:::: When: June 29th - July 3rd, 3-5pm UK time. Where: Zoom ::::</strong></p>

<p>Would you like to use <b>machine learning as part of musical live coding</b>? Would you like to create your own live coding language? We are inviting you to participate in a free workshop that will take place online in early July. With daily videos, Zoom sessions and follow-up online hangouts, we will get you up and running in using our new technologies for using AI in live coding.</p>

<p>As part of our work in the <a href="http://www.mimicproject.com">MIMIC project</a>, we have created <b>Sema</b>: an online system for live coding with AI in the browser. Here you can apply many of the machine learning technologies we have implemented as part of our MIMIC work, but moreover: you can design your own live coding language!</p>

<p><img src="/img/Semascreenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of Sema" />
<em>A screenshot of Sema. Take a look at the three videos of Sema in action below.</em></p>

<p>We believe every new live coding language results in new musical approaches, which implies that for a diversity of music we need a diversity of languages. Sema enables you to write your own language, whether it is one piece of music, an instrument, a pattern generator, or a full blown live coding language.</p>

<p>Sema will be officially launched just before the start of the workshop, so you will be one of the first users to test this new technology and design your own live coding languages for machine learning in music.</p>

<p>There is no previous experience required to participate in this Sema workshop. Although you do not need any machine learning expertise, you will benefit from beginner-level JavaScript programming skills. You donâ€™t even have to be an experienced musician. This workshop will introduce the basic concepts of musical live coding with AI, and get people up to speed in using Sema and creating their own live coding languages. We are hoping that workshop participants will contribute in a user-study that will help us to develop the system further.</p>

<p>We will run a flipped-learning workshop where we release introductory tutorial videos each day and workshop participants study them in their own time. We then have a synchronous Zoom Q&amp;A workshop session at 3pm every day.</p>
