<p>(Research in progress) A study in interactive music theatre: In this first experiment of Thanosâ€™ research on interactive music theatre, he is embarking on an exploration of the voice. Aided by improvisation as well as by fully written score, we have considered the instrumentâ€™s range, colours, and expressive possibilities. Moreover, this first study engaged with the subject of audience interaction beyond the traditional operatic setup.</p>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/modularbrains/hertzianfield-1">Hertzian Field #1</a> is an augmented reality surround sound environment that sonifies the dispersal of radio waves in a space caused by bodies and movement. The first of a series of pieces to come, this environment features an innovative interaction system inspired by an obscure surveillance technique. â€œWe make wide daily use of electromagnetic radiation and depend on it increasingly to wirelessly transmit and receive information of all sorts, for all sorts of uses. Apart from carrying and distributing our data, wireless communication has a side effect: it conveys physical information about space and our own bodies as we move unawares through turbulent rivers of radio waves.â€</p>
